# KQL Joins visualised

This poster is meant to help visualise the results of all the different types of KQL joins:

- The left circle is teal-colored, and the right circle is a darker shade of blue.
- If a certain part of a circle is colored it means that the Join-type (noted below the circle) will return that data.
- When data of both circles is returned by the Join-type the resulting color is a mix of both circles' color.
- The letters in the circles are added to increase understanding of what is actually returned, and helps differentiate between anti and normal joins
